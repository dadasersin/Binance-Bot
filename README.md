# n8n on Render

This repository contains the configuration files required to deploy [n8n](https://n8n.io/) on [Render](https://render.com/) using Docker and PostgreSQL.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Fork or Copy this Repository:** Ensure these files are in your own GitHub repository.
2. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - Click **New** > **Blueprint**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select this repository.
3. **Configure the Blueprint:**
   - Provide a name for the Blueprint (e.g., `n8n-stack`).
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and prepare the following resources:
     - **n8n-db:** A PostgreSQL database.
     - **n8n:** A Web Service running the n8n Docker image.
     - **n8n-data:** A persistent disk mounted at `/home/node/.n8n`.
4. **Deploy:** Click **Deploy Blueprint**.
5. **Initial Setup:**
   - Once the deployment is complete, open the URL provided by Render for the `n8n` service.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to create your owner account.

## Configuration Details

- **Database:** Uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.
- **Persistence:** A 1GB persistent disk is used to store binary data and internal n8n files.
- **Encryption Key:** Automatically generated by Render via the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

## Notes

- **Free Tier:** The default `render.yaml` uses the Free tier for both the database and the web service. Note that the Free database expires after 90 days, and the web service will spin down after inactivity. For production use, consider upgrading to a paid plan.
- **n8n Version:** Uses the `latest` official image from Docker Hub.
